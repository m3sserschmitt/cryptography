# Project Title

OpenSSL RSA and AES cryptography.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

You need OpenSSL library to be installed on your machine. Type this command in your terminal:

`openssl version`

### Installing

You need a copy of source code. Download the repository using git:

`git clone https://github.com/m3sserschmitt/cryptography.git`

Extract the source code, then:

`cd /your/source/code/path`

You are ready to build the library from source code:

`make`

Last command will create the file `cryptography.so` which can be linked in other
C/C++ projects.
